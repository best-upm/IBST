                <p>Let’s face it, we probably all sit at our computers for way too long without getting up. Yes, there’s work to be done, games to be played, and the internet abounds with people who are wrong and must be down-voted and/or corrected. We totally get and respect all that. However, if you want to maintain your middle- and long-range vision, you should really get up regularly and gaze out the window for a bit.</p>

Its Arduino Nano and accelerometer check your position every ten minutes. If you haven’t changed your Z by the third check, then it’s time for a break. The combination of an RGB LED, buzzer, and vibrating disc motor working together should be enough to pull you out of any computerized stupor, and they won’t give up and go back to sleep until you have stood up and remained upright for one minute.</p>
                <p>We like that [ardutronics123] spun up a board and made it small enough to be wrist-mounted using a watch strap. It would work just as well worn around your neck, and would probably even fit in your pocket. Blink a few times before you check out the build video after the break.</p>
                <p>Arduband would be great on the go, but who does that anymore? <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/01/29/lazydoro-mothers-you-into-being-productive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you spend every day at the same desk, you could point a time-of-flight sensor at your chair and start a timer</a>.</p>
