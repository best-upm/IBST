# IBST
Stands for Internal BEST Structure Tool
<br>
Nothing fancy...
<br>
The idea behind this flask app is to create a tool that helps BEST Internal structure. <br>
There are a few ideas behind this project, the main purpose was to create a voting app. Other ideas range from creating a KM Database (Knowledge Managment Database), a Git-flow based university-notes (so that each student can download Notes from other Students and add more information to it) or an HR-Tool to have some control over BEST Madrid Members

Does this project spark your Interest? Well, I still need to write a few things to set it up. (Alembic Database Migrations, Members tool API (Members control, Roles creation, etc), IRV (Instant Runoff Voting), Profile pages, Front page for Minutes and Info for events
